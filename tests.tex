\section{Connect to Master Server}
\subsection{Method}
A pair of servers with distinct ports will be initiated, and then a client program. Both servers and the client will then report which server they have decided is the master server through the \emph{get master} command.

\subsection{Expected Result}
All programs should give the same result when being queried for the name of the master server.

\subsection{Actual Result}
\subsubsection{Server A}
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./server.sh localhost 3125
Reading departments file "../departments.txt"
Found 30 department definitions
Reading hosts file "../hosts.txt"
Found 2 host definitions
Created new RMI registry at port 3125
Connected to RMI registry at localhost 3125
DatabaseConnection bound to registry
Polling servers to find identifier...
Server identifier: 1
Type "help" to get a list of all commands
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Server B}
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./server.sh localhost 3126
Reading departments file "../departments.txt"
Found 30 department definitions
Reading hosts file "../hosts.txt"
Found 2 host definitions
Created new RMI registry at port 3126
Connected to RMI registry at localhost 3126
DatabaseConnection bound to registry
Polling servers to find identifier...
Server identifier: 2
Synchronizing with master server...
Type "help" to get a list of all commands
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Client}
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./client.sh
Reading departments file "../departments.txt"
Found 30 department definitions
Reading hosts file "../hosts.txt"
Found 2 host definitions
Type "help" to get a list of all commands
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Server A}
\begin{verbatim}
> get master
host-a@localhost:3125
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Server B}
\begin{verbatim}
> get master
host-a@localhost:3125
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Client}
\begin{verbatim}
> get master
host-a@localhost:3125
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Verdict}
Success

\section{Record Insertion and Seletion}
\subsection{Method}
Following on from the previous test, the client will insert a data record into the master server's database with \emph{insert}, and then retrieve it again with \emph{select}.

\subsection{Expected Result}
The selected data should be identical to the inserted information.

\subsection{Actual Results}
\subsubsection{Client}
\begin{verbatim}
> insert James King 150 2 200
SUCCESS
#1 James King, Engineering and Computing Sciences, year 2, 200 credits

> select identifier == 1
Selected 1 item(s):
#1 James King, Engineering and Computing Sciences, year 2, 200 credits
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Verdict}
Success

\section{Swap Primary Server}
\subsection{Method}
Following the last test, the master server will be shut down and the client will make the same \emph{select} request again. Then the server will be restarted, and the other server shut down afterwards. Finally, the request will be executed one more time.

\subsection{Expected Result}
The select request should provide the same data as was originally inserted each time.

\subsection{Actual Results}
\subsubsection{Server A}
\begin{verbatim}
> exit
Exiting...
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Client}
\begin{verbatim}
> select identifier == 1
Selected 1 item(s):
#1 James King, Engineering and Computing Sciences, year 2, 200 credits
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Server A}
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./server.sh localhost 3125

Reading hosts file "../hosts.txt"
